PIZZA APPa

This is a simple application that calculates the amount of pizza slices a user can have given the size of the pizza pie, and then charges an exorbiant amount of money for that pie.  

Some features include:

--> Letting the user select the number of inches for the diameter of the pie.
--> Return how many slices that pie will have.
--> Alerts the user if the pizza pie is too big or too small.
--> Alerts the user if an error has occurred in the input. 

OVerall, a fun app to build.  I am very scared of math, so the problem solving I had to do (figure out the area of an individual slice if I know the area of the pie and then divide that by 8) was great.
